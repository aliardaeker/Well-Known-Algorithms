C++ Programs to simulate essential algorithm concepts such as searching, recursion, graph theory, matrix multiplication and backtracking with random inputs.

1) Exchange, insertion, merge, randomized quick sort. 

2) Heap sort with radix, large integer multiplication, Strassen matrix multiplication.

3) Floyd algorithm, largest common substring.

4) Prim`s and Kruskal`s  MST algorithms.

5) Knapsack problem with brute force, dynamic programming and backtraking solutions.
